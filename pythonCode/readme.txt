Here you will find optimized python code and associated notebooks to show how eigenvalue control for motif production depends on various parameters (Stability of eigenvalue control.ipynb; related to Fig. S2 F), and to quantify how well the optimization of the preparatory network works (Preparatory network optimization.ipynb and Preparatory network optimization - statistics.ipynb; related to Fig. 3 and Fig. S6).

Here the optimization of our cost functions uses gradient-based methods to quickly discover local minima. Our results show that gradient-based optimization can reach similar results as evolutionary optimizers as long as the network size is large enough.
