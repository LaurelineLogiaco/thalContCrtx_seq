code for 'Thalamic Control of Cortical Dynamics\\in a Model of Flexible Motor Sequencing'

Logiaco, Abbott, Escola

We are still working on making the code easily readable. The final version of the code will be ready by the time of publication.

We provide both an optimized python code where optimization of our cost functions uses gradient-based methods to quickly discover local minima,
and a matlab code where the optimization leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the discovery of nonlocal minima.
