# thalContCrtx_seq
code for 'Thalamic Control of Cortical Dynamics\\in a Model of Flexible Motor Sequencing'

Logiaco, Abbott, Escola

We provide both an extensively commented matlab code to understand and reproduce our main results (where the optimization leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the discovery of nonlocal minima) related to producing a single motif when starting from the right initial conditions, and an optimized python code where the optimization of our cost functions uses gradient-based methods to quickly discover local minima and which also contains code to optimize a "preparatory" thalamic module that allows transitions between motifs by setting the right initial state for each motif.

Do not hesitate to contact me (laureline.logiaco@gmail.com) if you need clarifications.
