# thalContCrtx_seq
code for 'Thalamic Control of Cortical Dynamics\\in a Model of Flexible Motor Sequencing'

Logiaco, Abbott, Escola

We are still working on making the code easily readable. The final version of the code is being slowly finalized. Do not hesitate to contact me (laureline.logiaco@gmail.com) if you need clarifications.

We provide both an extensively commented matlab code to understand and reproduce our results (where the optimization leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the discovery of nonlocal minima) and an optimized python code, where the optimization of our cost functions uses gradient-based methods to quickly discover local minima.
